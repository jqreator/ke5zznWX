This script is designed to retrieve personal weather station data from the Weather Underground API and upload it to APRS/CWOP.

My Acurite 5-in-1 weather station does not natively support pulling the weather data directly, but it will upload to WU. This seemed like a decent compromise without having to capture the packets midstream since the WU API is free to contributers.

Just enter your Callsign, APRS password, and WU API key.
